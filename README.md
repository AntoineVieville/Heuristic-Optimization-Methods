# Heuristic-Optimization-Methods
Heuristic Optimization course from FER - UniZg, taught by Pr. Lea Skorin-Kapov

The course goes over many heuristic search algorithms : greedy search, local search, random local search, GRASP, Simulated Annealing, Tabu search, Ant Colony Optimization, Particule Swarm Optimization.
The course also goes through algorithms complexity, Linear Programming, notion of P/NP problems, parameters initialization, parameters tuning.

The labs and projects were solved using Python.
